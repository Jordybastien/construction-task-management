# 🏗️ Construction Task Manager

> **Offline-first construction task management on interactive floor plans. Built with React, RxDB, and LeafletJS.**

## 🎯 The Problem

Construction teams need to manage tasks spatially on floor plans while working in environments with poor connectivity. Current solutions either lack spatial context or fail offline, creating friction in construction workflows.

## 🔍 Solution Analysis

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Verdict |
|----------|------|------|---------|
| **Generic Task Apps** | Simple, familiar | No spatial context, online-only | ❌ Wrong tool |
| **CAD Software** | Professional precision | Complex, expensive, desktop-only | ❌ Overkill |
| **Static Image + DOM** | Fast development | Poor performance, no real coordinates | ❌ Not scalable |
| **Canvas-based Custom** | Full control, performant | High complexity, reinventing wheels | ⚠️ Over-engineered |
| **LeafletJS + Canvas** | Professional mapping, proven, extensible | Learning curve | ✅ **Selected** |

## 🗺️ Why LeafletJS + Canvas Overlay?

**Professional foundation**: LeafletJS handles coordinate systems, zoom/pan, and layer management - exactly what construction mapping needs.

**Performance at scale**: Canvas overlays provide hardware-accelerated rendering for drawing tools while maintaining 60fps with hundreds of tasks.

**Real-world precision**: Custom CRS (Coordinate Reference System) enables millimeter-accurate positioning and measurements.

**Offline-ready**: Tile caching and offline-first architecture work seamlessly with construction site realities.

## 🎯 Implementation Plan

### 📐 Low-Fidelity Wireframes

**Desktop Layout**: Three-panel interface with task list (left), interactive floor plan (center), and task details (right). Toolbar with drawing tools overlays the floor plan.

**Mobile Layout**: Single-screen navigation with collapsible panels and touch-optimized floor plan interactions.

**Key Components**: Task markers on floor plan, filterable task board, detailed checklist interface, drawing/annotation tools.

### 🔴 Phase 1: Core Foundation (Days 1-3)
